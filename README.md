![]([https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/MicroROS-Board/blob/main/MicroROS_Control_Board.jpg])
# Introduction
This MicroROS control board can also be named the Raspberry Pi 5 robot expansion board. It has an ESP32S3 chip as co-processor, 4-channel encoder motor driver, 2-channel PWM servo driver, 1-channel laser lidar interface, 6-axis IMU attitude sensor and other important peripherals. Supports WiFi, Bluetooth, serial port and other communication functions. MicroROS firmware is pre-installed on this control board before shipment, which can communicate with the devices installed with the ROS2 system. Combined with MS200 lidar and 310 motor in Yahboom store, you can create Micro ROS robots, Raspberry Pi 5 cars, etc.
# Features
* It is recommended to use the MS200 lidar and 310 motor fromYahboom. If you want to use other lidars and motors, please check the interface wiring sequence in the product
* Supports the Raspberry Pi 5 power supply protocol, providing 5.1V 5A power supply to ensure that the Raspberry Pi 5 reaches its maximum potential.
* Equipped with ESP32 co-processor, it can realize remote communication mode within WIFI-UDP LAN based on microROS,and also supports serial communication mode.
* Onboard encoder motor, PWM servo, lidar interface, 6-axis IMU attitude sensor, buzzer, LED light and other equipment, suitable for ROS2
* Only supports ROS2, not supports ROS1, and we will provide ROS2 robot function package to help users build robots.
